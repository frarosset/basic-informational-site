# basic-informational-site
A very simple site is built using HTML, CSS and JS, that shows the picture of the day sourced from [NASAâ€™s Astronomy Picture of the Day  (APOD) API](https://api.nasa.gov/).

A very simple NodeJS server is setup, that serves the correct page of the site.

To see a live preview of the site, go to [this repl](https://replit.com/@frarosset/basic-informational-site) and start the server (`node server.js`).

The screenshot of the website are reported next.
